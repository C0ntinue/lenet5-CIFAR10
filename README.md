# lenet5-CIFAR10
This is part of the final project of COMP551 (Winter2020).We were asked to compare the performances of the MLP and CNN model on the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. I was responsible for training the Lenet5 network.

## Content
The iPython notebook in this repo includes
- dataset loading
- Lenet5 definition(Pytorch)
- Hyperparameters tuning(learning rate and dropout rate)
- test with data augmentation
- confusion matrix and ROC curve

# Result 
The best accuracy we got using a data augmented training set was 74.450 %.
